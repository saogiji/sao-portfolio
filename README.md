# SIMON ADANU OGIJI - PORTFOLIO

This is a simple responsive web design I created to tell my story and easily connect with others who share my interests. To complete this task, I had to take a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) responsive Web Design Certification course.

## Sections

The web page is divided into sections that help organize my story for easy comprehension and user navigation.

- ### Introduction

  This is mostly about waves :wave: and a quick overview of myself. I couldn't offer a physical handshake as I say "Hi, I'm Simon, A Product Manager..." but believe me, you will feel it as you read. :grinning:

- ### Bio

  I've got quite a story to tell, and I've made every effort to make it interesting.

- ### Skills

  I used some of my skills to create this webpage, but I have many more, so this section lists them all, organized under different headings.

- ### Projects

  I created a couple of other cool designs during my freeCodeCamp course, but my interest is in Product Management, and I will be back soon to update the projects section with more amazing projects (both hypothetical and real) as I journey through my transition from Computer Engineer to Product Manager with [EntryLevel.](https://app.entrylevel.net/)

- ### Contacts
  I want to connect with people who share my interests, so the contact section and footer provide various ways to contact me.

## My process

The process used to design and deploy this simple webpage can be broken down into five simple steps;

- ### Layout
  I used HTML to create the layout, everything was jammed together when I was done and it was time to add some styles to it. :wink:
