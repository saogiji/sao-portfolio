# SIMON ADANU OGIJI - PORTFOLIO

This is a simple responsive web design I created to tell my story and easily connect with others who share my interests. To complete this task, I had to take a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) responsive Web Design Certification course.

## Sections

The web page is divided into sections that help organize my story for easy comprehension and user navigation.

- ### Introduction

  This is mostly about waves :wave: and a quick overview of myself. I couldn't offer a physical handshake as I say "Hi, I'm Simon, A Product Manager..." but believe me, you will feel it as you read. :grinning:

- ### Bio

  I've got quite a story to tell, and I've made every effort to make it interesting.

- ### Skills

  I used some of my skills to create this webpage, but I have many more, so this section lists them all, organized under different headings.

- ### Projects

  I created a couple of other cool designs during my freeCodeCamp course, but my interest is in Product Management, and I will be back soon to update the projects section with more amazing projects (both hypothetical and real) as I journey through my transition from Computer Engineer to Product Manager with [EntryLevel.](https://app.entrylevel.net/)

- ### Contacts
  I want to connect with people who share my interests, so the contact section and footer provide various ways to contact me.

## My process

The process used to design and deploy this simple webpage can be broken down into five simple steps;

- ### Layout
  I used HTML to create the layout; when I was finished, everything was smashed together and it was time to add some styles. :wink:
- ### styles
  I styled the page with CSS and added some cool colors before making it more interactive.
- ### Interactivity
  I used JavaScript to toggle the page from light to dark mode, as well as create a cool hand emoji at the bottom of the page to navigate right back to the top.
- ### Inspection
  Before committing to github, I wanted to sneak a peek:smiley: the inspect tool of chrome was just the right tool for that, allowing me to switch layouts and inspect how my page would look on mobile devices as well as personal computers.
- ### Deployment
  When it came time to deploy, I had a few options but ultimately chose [vercel.](https://vercel.com/). It is simple to use, as I have used it in previous projects during my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) course.

## My lessons

saogiji 1:1, RSE: Shew my thy knowledge without thy works, and I will shew thee my works by my knowledge.
Oh RSE is Revised Standard Edition:rofl:

## Continued development

I'm going to concentrate on JavaScript now because my interest has shifted to building web3 products and I want to know everything there is to know about web3. My next project could be a smart contract.
